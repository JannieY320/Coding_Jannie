            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>There is evidence that puppets have existed in England for the past 600 years! During the Medieval Period, travelling minstrels used hand puppets. Early puppet shows were probably based on Bible stories, and Greek or Roman legends. In London, the earliest recorded puppet plays took place at around 1600.</p>
